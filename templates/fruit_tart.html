                <p>Custard fruit tarts are elegant desserts featuring a crisp, buttery pastry crust filled with smooth, creamy custard. The custard is often made from a blend of milk, cream, sugar, and eggs, thickened to a luscious consistency. Once filled, the tarts are typically topped with an array of fresh fruits, such as berries, kiwi, mango, or citrus slices, which add vibrant colors and refreshing flavors.</p>

                    <p>Steps:</p>
                    <ol class="steps">
                        <li>In a large bowl, combine egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Use a whisk and mix until combined and the sugar is dissolved.</li>
                        <li>Place the milk in the saucepan and heat over medium-low heat for about 5 minutes or until it simmers. Donâ€™t let the milk boil, keep stirring to prevent the milk from overflowing.</li>
                        <li>Slowly add the milk to the egg yolk mixture, about 1/4 cup at a time, and stir constantly. Once all the milk has been added to the egg yolk mixture, place it into the saucepan and cook until it thickens.</li>
                        <li>Transfer the custard to a clean bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the fridge to chill for at least 2 hours. Make sure the plastic wrap touches the surface of the custard. This will help prevent it from forming a skin on top.</li>
                        <li>Fill a decorating bag or ziplock bag with chilled custard. Use a kitchen shears and snip the tip of the bag. Squeeze the bag and fill the tart shell with the custard. Use an offset spatula to smooth the top.</li>
                        <li>Top your mini custard fruit tarts with your favorite fruits. Heat a tablespoon of apricot preserve in a microwave, use a pastry brush, and glaze the top of your fruits. Another option is to use a small strainer and sprinkle mini tarts with powdered sugar.</li>
                        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
